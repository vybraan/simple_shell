# Simple Shell

## Why Shell exists
Unix is an operating system created in 1969 by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs. It was designed to be simple, efficient, and powerful. The shell is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with the operating system by executing commands.

## What I'll be creating
I'll be creating a simple Unix-like shell in C programming language by using system calls to execute commands and implementing basic shell functionalities such as parsing user input, handling signals, and managing child processes.
