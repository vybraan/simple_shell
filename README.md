# simple_shell

Unix is a powerful operating system that was originally developed in the 1960s by a group of AT&T Bell Labs researchers led by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie.

One of the key components of Unix is the shell, which is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with the system and execute commands. The shell provides a powerful and flexible way to manipulate files, manage processes, and perform other tasks on the system.

In this project, I will be creating a simple Unix-like shell using the C programming language. The shell will support basic command-line features such as command execution, input/output redirection, and pipeline commands. The shell will also include support for built-in commands such as cd (change directory) and exit (exit the shell).

To create the shell, I will start by implementing a basic parser that can read and interpret user input. I will then implement the core command execution logic, which will involve creating child processes and executing user commands within those processes. Finally, I will add support for input/output redirection and pipeline commands to allow users to chain commands together and manipulate input and output streams.

Overall, this project will provide an opportunity to learn more about Unix systems programming, C programming, and command-line interfaces.
